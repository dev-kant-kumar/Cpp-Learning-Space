# Cpp-Learning-Space

Welcome to the `Cpp-Learning-Space` repository! This repository contains all the code I have written while learning C++. It is organized into two main folders: `College Class Work` and `Self Learning`, each containing various subfolders to categorize the code based on different learning contexts and topics.

## Repository Structure

### 1. College Class Work

This folder includes all the C++ code written for college assignments, homework, and practice problems. It is further divided into subfolders to categorize the work:

- **Assigned Problem**: Code written for specific college assignments and class work.
- **Code Scan**: Solutions to homework problems given during college classes, including code from other classmates.
- **Practice Ground**: Code written to practice and improve understanding of college assignments and homework problems, as well as to accomplish any problem while working on class work or testing new learning concepts.

### 2. Self Learning

This folder contains all the C++ code written outside the college curriculum. It includes self-learning projects, experiments, and advanced topics that go beyond the college syllabus:

- **Projects**: Self-initiated projects to apply and test C++ concepts.
- **Experiments**: Code written to experiment with new C++ features or libraries.
- **Advanced Topics**: Code exploring advanced C++ topics beyond the college curriculum.

> Note: The folder structure may change in the future according to the situation.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse through the folders**: Navigate through the `College Class Work` and `Self Learning` folders to find code related to different learning contexts.
2. **Refer to the subfolders**: Each subfolder contains specific topics or types of exercises, making it easy to find relevant code.
3. **Review and run the code**: Each code file is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and concepts used. Feel free to review and run the code to enhance your understanding.
